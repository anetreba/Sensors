# Sensors

Work with different sensors such as acceleromete, magnetometer ect.

#Devices

LAUNCHXL-CC1352R1, BOOSTXL-SENSORS, RS, Logic analyzer Saleae.

##T00

An app that turns on the LED, run a UART with data processing, and in a loopread one line from UART input and then write it using UART output.

##T01

An app that gets temperature, pressure and humidity from a BME280 sensor and write them in a console every 10 seconds.

##T02

Connection of a logic analyzer on the SCL and SDA lines and launch the Saleae Logic program.

##T03

Work with an accelerometer, a magnetometer and a gyroscop. An app that reads data from all these sensors for getting a complete picture of the orientation of the device in space. Work of the BMI160 sensor must be based on the data from BMM150.

##T04

Work with a photodetector. An app that will measure the luminous flux per unit area. An OPT3001 Ambient Light Sensor. The program write this data in a console every 10 seconds.
